# **27 Chapter 27: Modelling, Visualising and Analysing Network Data with R**

## **27.1 Overview**

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.

By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:

-   create graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of *dplyr*, *lubridate*, and *tidygraph*,

-   build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of *ggraph*,

-   compute network geometrics using *tidygraph*,

-   build advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and

-   build interactive network visualisation using *visNetwork* package.

## **27.2 Getting Started**

### **27.2.1 Installing and launching R packages**

In this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.

The code chunk:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, 
               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,
               tidyverse, graphlayouts)
```

## **27.3 The Data**

The data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.

### **27.3.1 The edges data**

-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.

### **27.3.2 The nodes data**

-   *GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.
