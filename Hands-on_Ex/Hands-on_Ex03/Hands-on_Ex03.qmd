# **3 Programming Interactive Data Visualisation with R**

## **3.1 Learning Outcome**

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by **ggiraph** and **plotlyr** packages.

## **3.2 Getting Started**

First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:

-   [**ggiraph**](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/) for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.

-   [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/), R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.

-   [**DT**](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) provides an R interface to the JavaScript library [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) that create interactive table on html page.

-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.

-   [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.

The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, 
               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) 
```

## **3.3 Importing Data**

In this section, *Exam_data.csv* provided will be used. Using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of **readr** package, import *Exam_data.csv* into R.

The code chunk below `read_csv()` of **readr** package is used to import *Exam_data.csv* data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called `exam_data`.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## **3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods**

[ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap03/img/image1.jpg){width="92"} is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.

Interactive is made with [**ggplot geometries**](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/#section-interactive-geometries) that can understand three arguments:

-   **Tooltip**: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.

-   **Onclick**: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.

-   **Data_id**: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.

If it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this [article](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/articles/offcran/shiny.html) for more detail explanation.

### **3.4.1 Tooltip effect with *tooltip* aesthetic**

Below shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using **ggiraph** package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, [`girafe()`](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph/reference/girafe.html) of **ggiraph** will be used to create an interactive svg object.

```{r}

library(ggiraph)

p <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot_interactive(
    aes(tooltip = ID),
    stackgroups = TRUE, 
    binwidth = 1, 
    method = "histodot") +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, 
                     breaks = NULL)
girafe(
  ggobj = p,
  width_svg = 6,
  height_svg = 6*0.618
)
```
