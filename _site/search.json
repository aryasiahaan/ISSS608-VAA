At the same time, you will gain hands-on experience on using these components to plot statistical graphics based on the principle of Layered Grammar of Graphics. By then end of this chapter you will be able to apply the essential graphical elements provided by ggplot2 to create elegant and yet functional statistical graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.\nThe code chunk below use p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk on the right assumes that you already have pacman package installed.

Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?\nAs pointed out by Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us call the ggplot() function using the code chunk on the right.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (in later part of this lesson, you will see that each geom layer can have its own aes specification)\nCode chunk below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\naes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user.

As far as I know, R does not differentiate between ‘dbl’ and ‘num’, so in this case I will leave it as ‘dbl’ data type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq4_2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\")\n\nRows: 4851 Columns: 21\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (15): Project Name, Sale Date, Address, Type of Sale, Type of Area, Nett...\ndbl  (1): Number of Units\nnum  (5): Transacted Price ($), Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM),...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nq1_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\n\nRows: 4902 Columns: 21\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (15): Project Name, Sale Date, Address, Type of Sale, Type of Area, Nett...\ndbl  (1): Number of Units\nnum  (5): Transacted Price ($), Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM),...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI also noticed that the Sale Date column data type format in all of these five datasets are in ‘chr’ (character). I will parse/convert them into date-time format.\n\n\nData will be processed using appropriate tidyverse family of packages. Statistical graphics will be created using ggplot2 and its extensions.\nParsing the Sale Date column into date-time format using ‘lubridate’ package\n\nq1_2023 &lt;- q1_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`))\n\nq2_2023 &lt;- q2_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`))\n\nq3_2023 &lt;- q3_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`))\n\nq4_2023 &lt;- q4_2023 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`))\n\nq1_2024 &lt;- q1_2024 %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Sale Date` = dmy(`Sale Date`))\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe mutate() function is used to modify the Sale Date column directly.\n\nSince the column name has a space in it, I need to use backticks to refer to it within the mutate() function.\n\nThe dmy() function from the lubridate package will parse the date strings into actual Date objects.\n\nNext using the code below, I will check and confirmed that the data types have been converted properly.\n\nclass(q1_2023$`Sale Date`)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\nclass(q2_2023$`Sale Date`)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\nclass(q3_2023$`Sale Date`)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\nclass(q4_2023$`Sale Date`)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\nclass(q1_2024$`Sale Date`)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nStep 5: Merge the Data\nAfter standardizing the data in all five datasets, I will then merge these datasets together using the bind_rows() function from the dplyr package.

The trend shows significant fluctuation throughout the period, with peaks and troughs corresponding to market activity. Notably, there’s a sharp increase in March 2023, suggesting a spike in sales, possibly due to market stimuli or seasonal factors. The overall pattern indicates a resilient market, yet with periods of reticence, potentially reflective of economic events or policy changes. The red dotted line represents the average sales volume across the period, providing a benchmark against which to compare monthly performance. The months above this line saw higher-than-average sales, whereas those below saw fewer transactions, highlighting the varying buyer activity throughout the year.\n\n# Assuming 'combined_data' is your dataframe and has a column 'Property Type'\n# and 'Number of Units' for each transaction\n\n# First, we aggregate the number of units sold by property type\nproperty_type_distribution &lt;- combined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Transactions = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Now, we plot the distribution\nproperty_type_chart &lt;- ggplot(property_type_distribution, aes(x = `Property Type`, y = Transactions, fill = `Property Type`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Property Type Distribution in Singapore Private Residential Market\",\n       x = \"Property Type\",\n       y = \"Number of Transactions\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(property_type_chart)"

The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

    "text": "Loading Packages\n\n\n\nLibrary\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npacman\nPacman is a package that makes it possible to perform tasks associated with add-on packages in a more convenient manner. It checks whether the add-on packages are installed or not. If not, it will automatically install and load them into the R environment. In this take-home exercise 1, the pacman package has been installed beforehand.\n\n\ntidyverse\nA collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. Content includes: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, forcats, scales, lubridate, etc.\n\n\nscales\nThis package is designed to enhance how data is presented in visualisation, particularly in ggplot2 plots. It provides tools for mapping data to aesthetic attributes like colours, shapes, and sizes more effectively. It also includes functions for formatting and transforming axes and legends in a chart. Even though this is part of the tidyverse package collection, it needs to be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\nlubridate\nIt is a package to work with date-times and time-spans: fast and user-friendly parsing of date-time data, extraction and updating of components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time and time-span objects. This is part of the tidyverse collection, but it is not automatically loaded, so I will need to load it explicitly as I plan to use its functionality.\n\n\nggrepel\nAn R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels. This is not part of the tidyverse package collection, but it is an extension of ggplot2.\n\n\nggthemes\nAnother separate R package that provides additional themes and scales for ggplot2 to enhance the appearance of plots. This package will also need to be installed and loaded independently.\n\n\nhrbrthemes\nThis package provides additional typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2, focused on improving readability and appearance for data visualisation. It must be installed and loaded independently.\n\n\npatchwork\nThis one is also an extension package for ggplot2 that allows combining multiple ggplot2 plots into one (composite figure) and arranging them in various layouts. Even though patchwork complements the functionality of ggplot2, it is independently maintained and must be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\n\nThe following code chunk utilises the p_load() function from the pacman package to ensure that the necessary packages are available in the R environment. If the packages are already installed on the computer, p_load() will load them. If they are not installed, it will first install them and then load them into the R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, scales,\n               lubridate, ggrepel, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes, \n               patchwork, knitr)"

The trend exhibits significant fluctuations throughout the period, with peaks and troughs corresponding to market activities. Notably, there is a sharp increase in March 2024 as compared to February 2024, suggesting a spike in sales. Huttons Asia’s chief executive, Mark Yip, attributes this to the resumption of project launches in March following the Chinese New Year festive lull, which had a spillover effect on the resale market (Yip, 2024). The red dotted line represents the average sales volume over the period, providing a benchmark for monthly performance comparison. Months above this line experienced higher-than-average sales, while those below indicated fewer transactions, highlighting the variable buyer activity throughout the year.\nCitation: Yip, M.

Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.
