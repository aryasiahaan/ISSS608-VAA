    "text": "In Oceanus, the island’s economy thrives on the movement of seafaring vessels, particularly those operated by commercial fishing companies, indicating a healthy economic state. However, a major event has disrupted these routines: SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught engaging in illegal fishing. This scandal caused significant turmoil within the close-knit fishing community. FishEye International, a non-profit dedicated to combating illegal fishing, seeks assistance to understand the impact of this event. They have been gathering and processing data on ship movements and shipping records to create CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph. While analysts at FishEye ensure data accuracy, they require assistance to develop analytical capabilities for this data.\n\n\n\nFishEye analysts require assistance in performing geographic and temporal analysis of the CatchNet data to prevent future instances of illegal fishing. The task involves developing innovative visual analytics tools and workflows designed to identify and understand signatures of various behaviors. One key objective is to visualize the signature of SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal activities. Additionally, there is a need to create a workflow capable of detecting other instances of illegal behavior within the data. These efforts are crucial for enhancing FishEye’s ability to monitor and combat illegal fishing effectively. This exercise will attempt to address Question 1 and Question 3 of this challenge.\n\n\nFishEye analysts have long wanted to better understand the flow of commercially caught fish through Oceanus’s many ports. But as they were loading data into CatchNet, they discovered they had purchased the wrong port records. They wanted to get the ship off-load records, but they instead got the port-exit records (essentially trucks/trains leaving the port area). Port exit records do not include which vessel that delivered the products. Given this limitation, develop a visualization system to associate vessels with their probable cargos. Which vessels deliver which products and when? What are the seasonal trends and anomalies in the port exit records?\n\n\n\nTo support further Fisheye investigations, develop visual analytics workflows that allow you to discover other vessels engaging in behaviors similar to SouthSeafood Express Corp’s illegal activities? Provide visual evidence of the similarities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, several R packages will be used to perform the following tasks:\n\nImporting graph data in json file format into R\nExtracting the nodes and edges (also known as links) from imported graph data.\nWrangling text data type.\nImporting geographical data in geojson file format into R,\nImporting geographical data in ESRI shapefile format into R,\nExtracting movement data from the edges table of a knowledge graph,\nDeriving a trajectory data from a movement data, and\nVisualising trajectory data to reveal geo-temporal patterns.\n\nThe following code chunk utilises the p_load() function from the pacman package to ensure that the necessary packages are available in the R environment. If the packages are already installed on the computer, p_load() will load them. If they are not installed, it will first install them and then load them into the R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, jsonlite, DataExplorer,\n               lubridate, ggplot2, tidygraph,\n               ggraph, igraph, sf, skimr) \n\n\n\n\nThe dataset for this exercise is available for download at the Vast Challenge 2024. As I undertake Mini-Challenge 2, I will utilize the dataset provided in the form of a JSON file named mc2.json.\nIn the code chunk below, fromJSON() of jsonlite package is used to import mc2.json file into R and save the output object.\n\nmc2_data &lt;- fromJSON(\"data/mc2.json\")\n\nThe output is called mc2_data. It is a large list R object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below extracts the links dataframe from mc2_data and saves it as a tibble dataframe called mc2_edges. The distinct() function is used to remove duplicates.\n\n# Wrangling and tidying edges\nmc2_edges &lt;- as_tibble(mc2_data$links) %&gt;% \n  distinct()\n\nNext, glimpse() of dplyr package will be used to reveal the structure of mc2_edges tibble data table\n\nglimpse(mc2_edges)\n\nRows: 271,643\nColumns: 17\n$ type                &lt;chr&gt; \"Event.TransportEvent.TransponderPing\", \"Event.Tra…\n$ time                &lt;chr&gt; \"2035-09-16T04:06:48.185987\", \"2035-09-20T05:21:33…\n$ dwell               &lt;dbl&gt; 115074.79, 412706.32, 286092.88, 327623.95, 243225…\n$ `_last_edited_by`   &lt;chr&gt; \"Olokun Daramola\", \"Melinda Manning\", \"Olokun Dara…\n$ `_date_added`       &lt;chr&gt; \"2035-09-16T00:59:46.300100\", \"2035-09-22T02:37:37…\n$ `_last_edited_date` &lt;chr&gt; \"2035-09-16T00:59:46.300100\", \"2035-09-22T02:37:37…\n$ `_raw_source`       &lt;chr&gt; \"Oceanus Vessel Locator System\", \"Oceanus Vessel L…\n$ `_algorithm`        &lt;chr&gt; \"OVLS-Catch&Hook\", \"OVLS-Catch&Hook\", \"OVLS-Catch&…\n$ source              &lt;chr&gt; \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of H…\n$ target              &lt;chr&gt; \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchpl…\n$ key                 &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,…\n$ date                &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ data_author         &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ aphorism            &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ holiday_greeting    &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ wisdom              &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ `saying of the sea` &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nFrom the table above, the following data issues can be identified:\n\nColumns with date and time data type are not in the correct format.\nThe column type also seems to contain three different types of information, namely: ‘Event’, ‘TransportEvent’, ‘TransponderPing’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, as_datetime() of lubridate package is used to convert fields with character date into POSIXt format.\n\nmc2_edges$time &lt;- as_datetime(mc2_edges$time)\nmc2_edges$\"date\" &lt;- as_datetime(\"mc2_edges$date\")\n\nNext, glimpse() will be used again to confirm if the process have been performed correctly.\n\nglimpse(mc2_edges)\n\nRows: 271,643\nColumns: 17\n$ type                &lt;chr&gt; \"Event.TransportEvent.TransponderPing\", \"Event.Tra…\n$ time                &lt;dttm&gt; 2035-09-16 04:06:48, 2035-09-20 05:21:33, 2035-09…\n$ dwell               &lt;dbl&gt; 115074.79, 412706.32, 286092.88, 327623.95, 243225…\n$ `_last_edited_by`   &lt;chr&gt; \"Olokun Daramola\", \"Melinda Manning\", \"Olokun Dara…\n$ `_date_added`       &lt;chr&gt; \"2035-09-16T00:59:46.300100\", \"2035-09-22T02:37:37…\n$ `_last_edited_date` &lt;chr&gt; \"2035-09-16T00:59:46.300100\", \"2035-09-22T02:37:37…\n$ `_raw_source`       &lt;chr&gt; \"Oceanus Vessel Locator System\", \"Oceanus Vessel L…\n$ `_algorithm`        &lt;chr&gt; \"OVLS-Catch&Hook\", \"OVLS-Catch&Hook\", \"OVLS-Catch&…\n$ source              &lt;chr&gt; \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of H…\n$ target              &lt;chr&gt; \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchpl…\n$ key                 &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,…\n$ date                &lt;dttm&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ data_author         &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ aphorism            &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ holiday_greeting    &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ wisdom              &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ `saying of the sea` &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nAs we can see now, the time and date columns have been converted to datetime format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the table above, we can see that the text in the type column is not tidy. I will tidy the type column by splitting it into three new separate columns called event1, event2, and event3. However, I will only keep the columns containing the values ‘TransportEvent’ and ‘TransponderPing’, which will be event2 and event3.\n\n\n\n\nword_list &lt;- strsplit(mc2_edges$type, \"\\\\.\")\n\n# The code chunk below will be used to find the maximum number of elements in any split\nmax_elements &lt;- max(lengths(word_list)) #to find the maximum number of elements in any split\n\n#The code chunk below will be used to pad shorter splits with NA values to make them all the same length.\nword_list_padded &lt;- lapply(word_list, \nfunction(x) c(x, rep(NA, max_elements - length(x)))) #to pad shorter splits with NA values to make them all the same length.\nword_df &lt;- do.call(rbind, word_list_padded)\ncolnames(word_df) &lt;- paste0(\"event\", 1:max_elements)\n\n# Since the output above is a matrix, the code chunk below is used to convert word_df into a tibble data.frame.\nword_df &lt;- as_tibble(word_df) %&gt;%\n  select(event2, event3)\n\n\n# The code chunk below appends the extracted columns back to mc2_edges tibble data.frame\nmc2_edges &lt;- mc2_edges %&gt;%\n  cbind(word_df)\n\nThis code splits the type column into multiple components, pads shorter entries with NAs, and integrates them back into the mc2_edges dataframe as new columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nAs we can see here, two new columns, event2 and event3, have been created and appended to the mc2_edges dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter cleaning and preparing the mc2_edges dataframe, I want to understand how the newly formed structure looks. Let’s make use of the DataExplorer package to visualize it.\nThe code below uses the plot_intro function, which is part of the DataExplorer package. This function provides a high-level summary of the mc2_edges dataframe, offering insights into its structure and content.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot introduction of the data\nplot_intro(mc2_edges, title = \"Introduction of mc2_edges Data\")\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_str function below generates a plot that visualizes the structure of mc2_edges dataframe, showing the relationships between different columns and their types.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate and display the data structure plot\nplot_str(mc2_edges)\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_missing function below generates a visualization that helps to identify and understand the distribution of missing values within mc2_edges dataframe.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot missing values\nplot_missing(mc2_edges, title = \"Missing Values in mc2_edges Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the initial EDA, I will remove columns from mc2_edges dataframe that are unnecessary to complete Mini-Challenge 2.\n\n\n\nmc2_edges_cleaned &lt;- mc2_edges %&gt;%\n  select(-c(`type`, `_last_edited_by`, `_date_added`, `_last_edited_date`, `_raw_source`, `_algorithm`, `key`,  `data_author`, `aphorism`, `holiday_greeting`, `wisdom`, `saying of the sea`))\n\nThe code above removes unnecessary columns from mc2_edges that are not needed for analysis, and then assigns the cleaned-up version to a new dataframe called mc2_edges_cleaned.\nNext, let’s use glimpse() to check what mc2_edges_cleaned looks like.\n\nglimpse(mc2_edges_cleaned)\n\nRows: 271,643\nColumns: 7\n$ time   &lt;dttm&gt; 2035-09-16 04:06:48, 2035-09-20 05:21:33, 2035-09-28 04:31:47,…\n$ dwell  &lt;dbl&gt; 115074.79, 412706.32, 286092.88, 327623.95, 243225.35, 109564.2…\n$ source &lt;chr&gt; \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"Ci…\n$ target &lt;chr&gt; \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", …\n$ date   &lt;dttm&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ event2 &lt;chr&gt; \"TransportEvent\", \"TransportEvent\", \"TransportEvent\", \"Transpor…\n$ event3 &lt;chr&gt; \"TransponderPing\", \"TransponderPing\", \"TransponderPing\", \"Trans…\n\n\nBefore moving to the next task, it would be wise to save the tidied mc2_edges_cleaned dataframe into a physical file for future use. By doing so, repeating the steps above will not be necessary.\nThe code chunk below will be used to save mc2_edges_cleaned into R rds file format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSince the file will be saved in the rds sub-folder within the data folder, ensure that the rds folder exists. If it does not, it needs to be created first.\n\n\n\nwrite_rds(mc2_edges_cleaned, \"data/rds/mc2_edges_cleaned.rds\")\n\nThis completes the data preparation process for the links dataframe of mc2_data, which is now stored in the mc2_edges_cleaned dataframe and saved as a physical mc2_edges_cleaned.rds file.\nThe next step is to clean and prepare the nodes dataframe of mc2_data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below extracts the nodes dataframe from mc2_data, parses it as a tibble dataframe called mc2_nodes, and removes duplicate rows using the distinct() function.\n\nmc2_nodes &lt;- as_tibble(mc2_data$nodes) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\nNext, the code chunk below uses the glimpse() function to reveal the data structure of the mc2_nodes tibble dataframe.\n\nglimpse(mc2_nodes)\n\nRows: 5,637\nColumns: 20\n$ type                 &lt;chr&gt;

They are:\nThe values in Activities and fish_species_present columns are in list data type, which will affect the ability to process and to analyze the data.\nAs shown in the screenshot below, some values in the Activities and fish_species_presentcolumn are not ready to be analyze without further tidying (i.e. removing c(““)).\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, mutate() from dplyr and gsub() from Base R are used to perform the data tidying task.\nThis cleans up the Activities and fish_species_present columns by removing unnecessary characters.\n\nmc2_nodes &lt;- mc2_nodes %&gt;%\n  mutate(Activities = gsub(\"c[(]\", \"\", Activities)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Activities = gsub(\"\\\"\", \"\", Activities)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Activities = gsub(\"[)]\", \"\", Activities)) \n\nmc2_nodes &lt;- mc2_nodes %&gt;%\n  mutate(fish_species_present = gsub(\"c[(]\", \"\", fish_species_present)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(fish_species_present = gsub(\"\\\"\", \"\", fish_species_present)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(fish_species_present = gsub(\"[)]\", \"\", fish_species_present)) \n\nAfter executing the code chunk above, we can see from the screenshot below, that the text field in Activities and fish_species_present columns have been tidied.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s use the DataExplorer package again to visualize the mc2_nodes dataframe in a similar manner as was done above for the mc2_edges dataframe.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot introduction of the data\nplot_intro(mc2_nodes, title = \"Introduction of mc2_nodes Data\")\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_str function below generates a plot that visualizes the structure of mc2_nodes dataframe, showing the relationships between different columns and their types.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate and display the data structure plot\nplot_str(mc2_nodes)\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_missing function below generates a visualization that helps to identify and understand the distribution of missing values within mc2_nodes dataframe.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot missing values\nplot_missing(mc2_nodes, title = \"Missing Values in mc2_nodes Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the initial EDA, I will remove columns from mc2_nodes dataframe that are unnecessary to complete Mini-Challenge 2.\n\n\n\nmc2_nodes_cleaned &lt;- mc2_nodes %&gt;%\n  select(-c(`_last_edited_by`, `_date_added`, `_last_edited_date`, `_raw_source`, `_algorithm`, `style`))\n\nThe code above removes unnecessary columns from mc2_nodes that are not needed for analysis, and then assigns the cleaned-up version to a new dataframe called mc2_nodes_cleaned.\nNext, let’s use glimpse() to check what mc2_nodes_cleaned looks like.\n\nglimpse(mc2_nodes_cleaned)\n\nRows: 5,637\nColumns: 14\n$ type                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Entity.Commodity.Fish\", \"Entity.Commodity.Fish\",…\n$ name                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Cod/Gadus n.specificatae\", \"Birdseye/Pisces frig…\n$ id                   &lt;chr&gt; \"gadusnspecificatae4ba\", \"piscesfrigus900\", \"pisc…\n$ Name                 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"Haacklee…\n$ Description          &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ Activities           &lt;chr&gt; \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"…\n$ kind                 &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, \"city\", \"…\n$ qty_tons             &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ date                 &lt;dttm&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ flag_country         &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ company              &lt;chr&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ tonnage              &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ length_overall       &lt;int&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ fish_species_present &lt;chr&gt; \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"NULL\", \"…\n\n\nThe tidied mc2_nodes_cleaned dataframe will then be saved into a physical file for future use. By doing so, repeating the steps above will not be necessary.\nThe code chunk below will be used to save mc2_nodes_cleaned into R rds file format.\n\nwrite_rds(mc2_nodes_cleaned, \"data/rds/mc2_nodes_cleaned.rds\")\n\nThis completes the data preparation process for the nodes dataframe of mc2_data, which is now stored in the mc2_nodes_cleaned dataframe and saved as a physical mc2_nodes_cleaned.rds file.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing the data preparation process, the next step is to perform the analysis required to complete Mini-Challenge 2. From the background information above, we know that “SouthSeafood Express Corp” has been caught fishing illegally. Now, let’s see what we can discover from the available data regarding their illegal behavior.\n\n\nNext, I will use the unique() function from the base R package to see all the distinct entries in the type column of the mc2_nodes_cleaned dataframe.\n\nunique(mc2_nodes_cleaned$type)\n\n [1] \"Entity.Commodity.Fish\"          \"Entity.Location.City\"          \n [3] \"Entity.Document.DeliveryReport\" \"Entity.Vessel.FishingVessel\"   \n [5] \"Entity.Vessel.Other\"            \"Entity.Vessel.Ferry.Passenger\" \n [7] \"Entity.Vessel.CargoVessel\"      \"Entity.Vessel.Ferry.Cargo\"     \n [9] \"Entity.Vessel.Research\"         \"Entity.Vessel.Tour\"            \n[11] \"Entity.Location.Point\"          \"Entity.Location.Region\"        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nThe type column from the nodes data seems to contain a mix of information. Some of the entries appear interesting and useful for analysis, including:\n\nEntity.Commodity.Fish\nEntity.Document.DeliveryReport\nEntity.Location.City\nEntity.Location.Point\nEntity.Location.Region\nEntity.Vessel.CargoVessel\nEntity.Vessel.FishingVessel\n\nThe other entries seem useless.\n\n\nNext, I will try to find out the count of each entry. The code chunk below allows me to see the count of unique value in each entry.\n\nnodes_type_counts &lt;- mc2_nodes_cleaned %&gt;%\n  group_by(type) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n())\n\n# Display the result\nprint(nodes_type_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   type                           count\n   &lt;chr&gt;

If the packages are already installed on the computer, p_load() will load them. If they are not installed, it will first install them and then load them into the R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, jsonlite, DataExplorer,\n               lubridate, ggplot2, tidygraph,\n               ggraph, igraph, sf, skimr) \n\n\n\n\nThe dataset for this exercise is available for download at the Vast Challenge 2024. As I undertake Mini-Challenge 2, I will utilize the dataset provided in the form of a JSON file named mc2.json.\nIn the code chunk below, fromJSON() of jsonlite package is used to import mc2.json file into R and save the output object.\n\nmc2_data &lt;- fromJSON(\"data/mc2.json\")\n\nThe output is called mc2_data.

I will tidy the type column by splitting it into three new separate columns called event1, event2, and event3. However, I will only keep the columns containing the values ‘TransportEvent’ and ‘TransponderPing’, which will be event2 and event3.\n\n\n\n\nword_list &lt;- strsplit(mc2_edges$type, \"\\\\.\")\n\n# The code chunk below will be used to find the maximum number of elements in any split\nmax_elements &lt;- max(lengths(word_list)) #to find the maximum number of elements in any split\n\n#The code chunk below will be used to pad shorter splits with NA values to make them all the same length.\nword_list_padded &lt;- lapply(word_list, \nfunction(x) c(x, rep(NA, max_elements - length(x)))) #to pad shorter splits with NA values to make them all the same length.\nword_df &lt;- do.call(rbind, word_list_padded)\ncolnames(word_df) &lt;- paste0(\"event\", 1:max_elements)\n\n# Since the output above is a matrix, the code chunk below is used to convert word_df into a tibble data.frame.\nword_df &lt;- as_tibble(word_df) %&gt;%\n  select(event2, event3)\n\n\n# The code chunk below appends the extracted columns back to mc2_edges tibble data.frame\nmc2_edges &lt;- mc2_edges %&gt;%\n  cbind(word_df)\n\nThis code splits the type column into multiple components, pads shorter entries with NAs, and integrates them back into the mc2_edges dataframe as new columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\nAs we can see here, two new columns, event2 and event3, have been created and appended to the mc2_edges dataframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter cleaning and preparing the mc2_edges dataframe, I want to understand how the newly formed structure looks. Let’s make use of the DataExplorer package to visualize it.\nThe code below uses the plot_intro function, which is part of the DataExplorer package. This function provides a high-level summary of the mc2_edges dataframe, offering insights into its structure and content.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot introduction of the data\nplot_intro(mc2_edges, title = \"Introduction of mc2_edges Data\")\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_str function below generates a plot that visualizes the structure of mc2_edges dataframe, showing the relationships between different columns and their types.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Generate and display the data structure plot\nplot_str(mc2_edges)\n\n\n\n\nThe plot_missing function below generates a visualization that helps to identify and understand the distribution of missing values within mc2_edges dataframe.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot missing values\nplot_missing(mc2_edges, title = \"Missing Values in mc2_edges Data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the initial EDA, I will remove columns from mc2_edges dataframe that are unnecessary to complete Mini-Challenge 2.\n\n\n\nmc2_edges_cleaned &lt;- mc2_edges %&gt;%\n  select(-c(`type`, `_last_edited_by`, `_date_added`, `_last_edited_date`, `_raw_source`, `_algorithm`, `key`,  `data_author`, `aphorism`, `holiday_greeting`, `wisdom`, `saying of the sea`))\n\nThe code above removes unnecessary columns from mc2_edges that are not needed for analysis, and then assigns the cleaned-up version to a new dataframe called mc2_edges_cleaned.\nNext, let’s use glimpse() to check what mc2_edges_cleaned looks like.\n\nglimpse(mc2_edges_cleaned)\n\nRows: 271,643\nColumns: 7\n$ time   &lt;dttm&gt; 2035-09-16 04:06:48, 2035-09-20 05:21:33, 2035-09-28 04:31:47,…\n$ dwell  &lt;dbl&gt; 115074.79, 412706.32, 286092.88, 327623.95, 243225.35, 109564.2…\n$ source &lt;chr&gt; \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"City of Haacklee\", \"Ci…\n$ target &lt;chr&gt; \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", \"perchplundererbc0\", …\n$ date   &lt;dttm&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ event2 &lt;chr&gt; \"TransportEvent\", \"TransportEvent\", \"TransportEvent\", \"Transpor…\n$ event3 &lt;chr&gt; \"TransponderPing\", \"TransponderPing\", \"TransponderPing\", \"Trans…\n\n\nBefore moving to the next task, it would be wise to save the tidied mc2_edges_cleaned dataframe into a physical file for future use.

    "text": "Reproducing The Original Process\nI will follow the step-by-step process performed by my classmate in order to reproduce the original visualisation.\n\nLoading The Packages\nFirst of all, let’s load all the required packages to reproduce the visualisation. The packages used are listed below:\n\n\n\nLibrary\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npacman\nPacman is a package that makes it possible to perform tasks associated with add-on packages in a more convenient manner. It checks whether the add-on packages are installed or not. If not, it will automatically install and load them into the R environment.\n\n\ntidyverse\nA collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. Content includes: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, forcats, scales, lubridate, etc.\n\n\npatchwork\nThis one is also an extension package for ggplot2 that allows combining multiple ggplot2 plots into one (composite figure) and arranging them in various layouts. Even though patchwork complements the functionality of ggplot2, it is independently maintained and must be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\nscales\nThis package is designed to enhance how data is presented in visualisation, particularly in ggplot2 plots. It provides tools for mapping data to aesthetic attributes like colours, shapes, and sizes more effectively. It also includes functions for formatting and transforming axes and legends in a chart. Even though this is part of the tidyverse package collection, it needs to be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\nzoo\nProvides powerful methods for managing and manipulating ordered indexed data, particularly time series data, making it easier to handle a variety of data irregularities.\n\n\n\nThese packages will be loaded using the p_load() function from the pacman package to ensure that all the necessary packages are available in the R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, lubridate, patchwork, scales, zoo)\n\n\n\nLoading The Data\n\nThe Datasets\nThere are five datasets in the form of CSV files used to produce the original visualisation. These datasets cover from the start of the 1st quarter 2023 to the end of the 1st quarter 2024.\n\nread_csv() function will be used to load these CSV files into the R environment to create five separate dataframes: data1, data2, data3, data4, and data5.\nbind_rows() from the dplyr package merges these five data frames into one large data frame called data.\nglimpse() provides a quick overview of the combined data frame.\n\n\ndata1 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160536.csv\")\ndata2 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308160736.csv\")\ndata3 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161009.csv\")\ndata4 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\")\ndata5 = read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\ndata &lt;- bind_rows(data1, data2, data3, data4, data5)\n\nglimpse(data)\n\nRows: 26,806\nColumns: 21\n$ `Project Name`                &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "Critique on Clarity and Aesthetics of the Original Visualisation\nOverall, the original visualisation aligns with the analytical goals by allowing for a detailed examination of both sales volume and pricing across projects, offering insights that can guide strategic decisions in real estate development. With that being said, there is still room for improvements, and some modifications would be beneficial to enhance its clarity and aesthetics.\n\nClarity\n\nLabel Overcrowding:\n\nThe project names on the x-axis are densely packed, making them hard to read. This affects the viewer’s ability to quickly identify and compare projects.\n\nScale and Balance:\n\nThe scale of the bar chart and box plot do not align well.\n\nData Visibility:\n\nIn the box plot, some boxes and whiskers are thin or compressed due to the wide range of data, which can make it difficult to discern differences between the median and quartile values across projects.\n\n\n\n\nAesthetics\n\nColor and Design:\n\nBoth plots use a simple, minimalistic color scheme which, while clean, could be enhanced to differentiate data points or groups more effectively. For example, different colors could be used to represent different quartiles in the box plot or to highlight projects with particularly high or low metrics in both plots.\n\nConsistency in Style:\n\nThere is a visual inconsistency between the bar chart and the box plot that could be distracting. The bar chart is filled with a solid color, while the box plot is more traditional with outlines. Harmonizing these styles could improve the overall cohesion of the visualization.\n\nUtilization of Space:\n\nThere’s significant empty space at the right end of both plots, especially noticeable in the box plot. This could be better utilized by compressing the x-axis or by providing additional contextual information or annotations.\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for Improvement\n\nImproving Label Readability:\n\nRotate the position of the plot to a horizontal layout.\nReducing the number of projects with the highest ‘Total_Units’ sold from top 25 to just top 10.\nAdditional annotations could help to convey key information better for the viewer.\nBoxplot may benefit from incorporating median price directly on the plot\nUpsizing the labels on the y-axis and the x-axis\nRepositioning the two plots from side-by-side to top-bottom alignment.\n\nAdjusting Scales and Ranges:\n\nAdjust the y-axis on the box plot to focus more closely on the interquartile range, possibly using a secondary axis or break in the axis to handle outliers.\nLabels and ticks on the axes should be more readable, and using formatted numbers (like millions or rounding off) can help in understanding the scales at a glance without overwhelming with too many digits.\n\nEnhanced Color Coding and Visibility:\n\nUse color more strategically to highlight differences in data, such as coloring bars or boxes based on performance tiers (e.g., high, medium, low sales volume or prices).\nApply consistent thematic styling across both plots to enhance the visual narrative.\nThe use of a single color, while minimalist, could be expanded to differentiate data further. Using a palette to distinguish between different quartiles or highlighting specific noteworthy data points could make the visual more engaging.\nUse different colours to denote different metrics like median, mean, or outliers in box plots.\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresale_data &lt;- data_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats &lt;- resale_data %&gt;%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects &lt;- project_stats %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, Total_Units) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order &lt;- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` &lt;- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\n\n\np_units &lt;- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = reorder(`Project Name`, Total_Units), y = Total_Units)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = 'steelblue') +  \n  geom_text(aes(label = paste(Total_Units, \"units sold\")), position = position_nudge(y = 8), hjust = 1.5, color = \"white\", size = 6) +  # Add annotations with \"units sold\"\n  coord_flip() +  # Flips the axes to make the bar chart horizontal\n  labs(x = \"Project Name\", y = \"Total Units Sold\") +  # Change axis labels and update names\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 20),  # Enlarge y-axis labels\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 30),  # Enlarge x-axis labels\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge x-axis title\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge y-axis title\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n  \n\n  \np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n  \n# Calculate the interquartile range to adjust y-axis limits more appropriately\niqr &lt;- IQR(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE)\nq1 &lt;- quantile(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nq3 &lt;- quantile(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nlower_bound &lt;- max(0, q1 - 1.5 * iqr)  \nupper_bound &lt;- q3 + 1.5 * iqr\n\n# Generate the boxplot with refined axis focus and number formatting\np_price &lt;- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"grey80\", colour = \"black\", outlier.colour = \"red\", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 1) +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the axes for horizontal layout\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), labels = scales::comma) +  # Apply comma for thousands\n  labs(x = \"Project Name\", y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 20),  # Enhance readability of the x-axis labels\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 30),  # Enhance readability of the y-axis labels\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge x-axis title\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge y-axis title\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n\n  )\n\n\n\np_combined &lt;- p_units / p_price # Change | to / to stack plots vertically\np_combined"

It is not a single package but a collection of modern R packages including but not limited to readr, tidyr, dplyr, ggplot, tibble, stringr, forcats and purrr.\nlubridate provides functions to work with dates and times more efficiently.\nggthemes is an extension of ggplot2. It provides additional themes beyond the basic themes of ggplot2.\ngtExtras provides some additional helper functions to assist in creating beautiful tables with gt, an R package specially designed for anyone to make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language.\nreactable provides functions to create interactive data tables for R, based on the React Table library and made with reactR.\nreactablefmtr provides various features to streamline and enhance the styling of interactive reactable tables with easy-to-use and highly-customizable functions and themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this study, a personal database in Microsoft Access mdb format called Coffee Chain will be used.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, odbcConnectAccess() of RODBC package is used used to import a database query table into R.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(RODBC)\ncon &lt;- odbcConnectAccess2007('data/Coffee Chain.mdb')\ncoffeechain &lt;- sqlFetch(con, 'CoffeeChain Query')\nwrite_rds(coffeechain, \"data/CoffeeChain.rds\")\nodbcClose(con)\n\n\nNote: Before running the code chunk, you need to change the R system to 32bit version. This is because the odbcConnectAccess() is based on 32bit and not 64bit\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to import CoffeeChain.rds into R.\n\n\nCode\ncoffeechain &lt;- read_rds(\"data/rds/CoffeeChain.rds\")\n\n\nNote: This step is optional if coffeechain is already available in R.\nThe code chunk below is used to aggregate Sales and Budgeted Sales at the Product level.\n\n\nCode\nproduct &lt;- coffeechain %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Product`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`target` = sum(`Budget Sales`),\n            `current` = sum(`Sales`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to plot the bullet charts using ggplot2 functions.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(product, aes(Product, current)) + \n  geom_col(aes(Product, max(target) * 1.01),\n           fill=\"grey85\", width=0.85) +\n  geom_col(aes(Product, target * 0.75),\n           fill=\"grey60\", width=0.85) +\n  geom_col(aes(Product, target * 0.5),\n           fill=\"grey50\", width=0.85) +\n  geom_col(aes(Product, current), \n           width=0.35,\n           fill = \"black\") + \n  geom_errorbar(aes(y = target,\n                    x = Product, \n                    ymin = target,\n                    ymax= target), \n                width = .4,\n                colour = \"red\",\n                size = 1) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot sparklines by using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsales_report &lt;- coffeechain %&gt;%\n  filter(Date &gt;= \"2013-01-01\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = month(Date)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Month, Product) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Sales = sum(Sales)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  select(Month, Product, Sales)\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the minimum, maximum and end othe the month sales.\n\n\nCode\nmins &lt;- group_by(sales_report, Product) %&gt;% \n  slice(which.min(Sales))\nmaxs &lt;- group_by(sales_report, Product) %&gt;% \n  slice(which.max(Sales))\nends &lt;- group_by(sales_report, Product) %&gt;% \n  filter(Month == max(Month))\n\n\nThe code chunk below is used to compute the 25 and 75 quantiles.\n\n\nCode\nquarts &lt;- sales_report %&gt;%\n  group_by(Product) %&gt;%\n  summarise(quart1 = quantile(Sales, \n                              0.25),\n            quart2 = quantile(Sales, \n                              0.75)) %&gt;%\n  right_join(sales_report)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(sales_report, aes(x=Month, y=Sales)) + \n  facet_grid(Product ~ ., scales = \"free_y\") + \n  geom_ribbon(data = quarts, aes(ymin = quart1, max = quart2), \n              fill = 'grey90') +\n  geom_line(size=0.3) +\n  geom_point(data = mins, col = 'red') +\n  geom_point(data = maxs, col = 'blue') +\n  geom_text(data = mins, aes(label = Sales), vjust = -1) +\n  geom_text(data = maxs, aes(label = Sales), vjust = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(data = ends, aes(label = Sales), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.5) +\n  geom_text(data = ends, aes(label = Product), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 1.0) +\n  expand_limits(x = max(sales_report$Month) + \n                  (0.25 * (max(sales_report$Month) - min(sales_report$Month)))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 12, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.1, 0)) +\n  theme_tufte(base_size = 3, base_family = \"Helvetica\") +\n  theme(axis.title=element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank(), \n        axis.ticks = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create static information dashboard by using gt and gtExtras packages.

    "text": "Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package.\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, the GGally, parcoords, parallelPlot and tidyverse packages will be used.\nThe code chunks below are used to install and load the packages in R.\n\npacman::p_load(GGally, parallelPlot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the World Happinees 2018 (http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/) data will be used. The data set is download at https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2018/WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.xls. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called wh.\n\nwh &lt;- read_csv(\"data/WHData-2018.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\n\n\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparallelPlot is an R package specially designed to plot a parallel coordinates plot by using ‘htmlwidgets’ package and d3.js. In this section, you will learn how to use functions provided in parallelPlot package to build interactive parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot an interactive parallel coordinates plot by using parallelPlot().\n\nwh &lt;- wh %&gt;%\n  select(\"Happiness score\", c(7:12))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             width = 320,\n             height = 250)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that some of the axis labels are too long. You will learn how to overcome this problem in the next step.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, rotateTitle argument is used to avoid overlapping axis labels.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the useful interactive feature of parallelPlot is we can click on a variable of interest, for example Happiness score, the monotonous blue colour (default) will change a blues with different intensity colour scheme will be used.\n\n\n\nWe can change the default blue colour scheme by using continousCS argument as shown in the code chunl below.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             continuousCS = \"YlOrRd\",\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, histoVisibility argument is used to plot histogram along the axis of each variables.\n\nhistoVisibility &lt;- rep(TRUE, ncol(wh))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE,\n             histoVisibility = histoVisibility)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggparcoord() of GGally package\nparcoords user guide\nparallelPlot"

This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\n\n\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees.

And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text().

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R.\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you are required to open a new Quarto document. Keep the default html authoring format.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(corrplot, ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n\n\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nwine &lt;- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\n\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than one way to build scatterplot matrix with R. In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\n\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both. This is because a correlation matrix is symmetric.\nTo show the lower half of the correlation matrix, the upper.panel argument will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chun below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\nDon’t worry about the details for now-just type this code into your R session or script. Let’s have more fun way to display the correlation matrix.\n\npanel.cor &lt;- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr &lt;- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr &lt;- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt &lt;- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt &lt;- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor &lt;- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the major limitation of the correlation matrix is that the scatter plots appear very cluttered when the number of observations is relatively large (i.e. more than 500 observations). To over come this problem, Corrgram data visualisation technique suggested by D. J. Murdoch and E. D. Chow (1996) and Friendly, M (2002) and will be used.\nThe are at least three R packages provide function to plot corrgram, they are:\n\ncorrgram\nellipse\ncorrplot\n\nOn top that, some R package like ggstatsplot package also provides functions for building corrgram.\nIn this section, you will learn how to visualising correlation matrix by using ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot package.\n\n\nOn of the advantage of using ggcorrmat() over many other methods to visualise a correlation matrix is it’s ability to provide a comprehensive and yet professional statistical report as shown in the figure below.\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p &lt; 0.05\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ncor.vars argument is used to compute the correlation matrix needed to build the corrgram.\nggcorrplot.args argument provide additional (mostly aesthetic) arguments that will be passed to ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot function. The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: corr, method, p.mat, sig.level, ggtheme, colors, lab, pch, legend.title, digits.\n\nThe sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in ggcorrmat() but in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nto build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics. (circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie)\n\n\n\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics. (circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie)\n\n\n\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

That means that if we do not account for how many water points are somewhere, we end up mapping total water point size rather than our topic of interest.\n\n\nWe will tabulate the proportion of functional water points and the proportion of non-functional water points in each LGA. In the following code chunk, mutate() from dplyr package is used to derive two fields, namely pct_functional and pct_nonfunctional.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct_functional = wp_functional/total_wp) %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct_nonfunctional = wp_nonfunctional/total_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour turn\n\n\n\nPlot a choropleth map showing the distribution of percentage functional water point by LGA\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(NGA_wp) +\n  tm_fill(\"pct_functional\",\n          n = 10,\n          style = \"equal\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          legend.hist = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,\n             alpha = 1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Rate map of functional water point by LGAs\",\n            legend.outside = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\n\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\n\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence.

    "text": "Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\n\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\n\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_fill(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).\n\nggplot(data = NGA_wp,\n       aes(x = \"\",\n           y = wp_nonfunctional)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic principles of boxplot.\nTo create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used.

Do you know why?\n\n\n\nNext, we will import respopagsex2011to2020.csv file into RStudio and save the file into an R dataframe called popagsex.\nThe task will be performed by using read_csv() function of readr package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npopdata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/aspatial/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nBefore a thematic map can be prepared, you are required to prepare a data table with year 2020 values. The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.\n\nYOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,\nECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,\nAGED: age group 65 and above,\nTOTAL: all age group, and\nDEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group\n\n\n\nThe following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:\n\npivot_wider() of tidyr package, and\nmutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package\n\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata %&gt;%\n  filter(Time == 2020) %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, \n              values_from=POP) %&gt;%\n  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6])\n         +rowSums(.[12])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+\nrowSums(.[13:15]))%&gt;%\nmutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %&gt;%\nmutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %&gt;%  \nmutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)\n/`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %&gt;%\n  select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, \n       `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, \n       `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase. This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), \n          .funs = funs(toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=FALSE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap: Thematic Maps in R\ntmap\ntmap: get started!\ntmap: changes in version 2.0\ntmap: creating thematic maps in a flexible way (useR!2015)\nExploring and presenting maps with tmap (useR!2017)\n\n\n\n\n\nsf: Simple Features for R\nSimple Features for R: StandardizedSupport for Spatial Vector Data\nReading, Writing and Converting Simple Features\n\n\n\n\n\ndplyr\nTidy data\ntidyr: Easily Tidy Data with ‘spread()’ and ‘gather()’ Functions"

    "text": "Two approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"Dependency ratio\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar() +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"jenks\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 5,\n          style = \"equal\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\n\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7866  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the RColorBrewer package.\n\n\nTo change the colour, we assign the preferred colour to palette argument of tm_fill() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          n = 6,\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the choropleth map is shaded in green.\nTo reverse the colour shading, add a “-” prefix.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the colour scheme has been reversed.\n\n\n\n\nMap layout refers to the combination of all map elements into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios. Colour settings and data classification methods covered in the previous section relate to the palette and break-points are used to affect how the map looks.\n\n\nIn tmap, several legend options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"jenks\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \\n(Jenks classification)\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntmap allows a wide variety of layout settings to be changed. They can be called by using tmap_style().\nThe code chunk below shows the classic style is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"-Greens\") +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"classic\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside map style, tmap also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.\nIn the code chunk below, tm_compass(), tm_scale_bar() and tm_grid() are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          title = \"No. of persons\") +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"Distribution of Dependency Ratio \\nby planning subzone\",\n            main.title.position = \"center\",\n            main.title.size = 1.2,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 0.35,\n            frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +\n  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reset the default style, refer to the code chunk below.\n\ntmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall multiple maps, also referred to as facet maps, are composed of many maps arrange side-by-side, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.\nIn tmap, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:\n\nby assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,\nby defining a group-by variable in tm_facets(), and\nby creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ncols in tm_fill()\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(c(\"YOUNG\", \"AGED\"),\n          style = \"equal\", \n          palette = \"Blues\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +\n  tmap_style(\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, small multiple choropleth maps are created by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(c(\"DEPENDENCY\",\"AGED\"),\n          style = c(\"equal\", \"quantile\"), \n          palette = list(\"Blues\",\"Greens\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by using tm_facets().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          style = \"quantile\",\n          palette = \"Blues\",\n          thres.poly = 0) + \n  tm_facets(by=\"REGION_N\", \n            free.coords=TRUE, \n            drop.shapes=FALSE) +\n  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,\n            title.position = c(\"center\", \"center\"), \n            title.size = 20) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().\n\nyoungmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"YOUNG\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\nagedmap &lt;- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ \n  tm_polygons(\"AGED\", \n              style = \"quantile\", \n              palette = \"Blues\")\n\ntmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N==\"CENTRAL REGION\", ])+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\", \n          style = \"quantile\", \n          palette = \"Blues\", \n          legend.hist = TRUE, \n          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,\n          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,\n            legend.height = 0.45, \n            legend.width = 5.0,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"),\n            frame = FALSE) +\n  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\n\ncreate graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of dplyr, lubridate, and tidygraph,\nbuild network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of ggraph,\ncompute network geometrics using tidygraph,\nbuild advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and\nbuild interactive network visualisation using visNetwork package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and lubridate, an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.\nThe code chunk:\n\n\nCode\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n\n\nGAStech-email_edges.csv which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_email_nodes.csv which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\nGAStech_edges &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using glimpse() of dplyr.\n\n\nCode\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n\n\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      &lt;dbl&gt; 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      &lt;dbl&gt; 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    &lt;chr&gt; \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    &lt;time&gt; 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     &lt;chr&gt; \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject &lt;chr&gt; \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe output report of GAStech_edges above reveals that the SentDate is treated as “Character” data type instead of date data type. This is an error! Before we continue, it is important for us to change the data type of SentDate field back to “Date”” data type.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the changes.\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_edges &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = FALSE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nboth dmy() and wday() are functions of lubridate package. lubridate is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.\ndmy() transforms the SentDate to Date data type.\nwday() returns the day of the week as a decimal number or an ordered factor if label is TRUE. The argument abbr is FALSE keep the daya spells in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of wday() will save in this newly created field.\nthe values in the Weekday field are in ordinal scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\n\n\n\nA close examination of GAStech_edges data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records. This is not very useful for visualisation.\nIn view of this, we will aggregate the individual by date, senders, receivers, main subject and day of the week.\nThe code chunk:\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_edges_aggregated &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  filter(MainSubject == \"Work related\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %&gt;%\n    summarise(Weight = n()) %&gt;%\n  filter(source!=target) %&gt;%\n  filter(Weight &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nfour functions from dplyr package are used. They are: filter(), group(), summarise(), and ungroup().\nThe output data.frame is called GAStech_edges_aggregated.\nA new field called Weight has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_graph\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday   Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 Saturday      13\n 2    41    43 Monday        11\n 3    35    31 Tuesday       10\n 4    40    41 Monday        10\n 5    40    43 Monday        10\n 6    36    32 Sunday         9\n 7    40    43 Saturday       9\n 8    41    40 Monday         9\n 9    19    15 Wednesday      8\n10    35    38 Tuesday        8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function.\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\n\nCode\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\n\nCode\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses theme() to change the position of the legend.\n\n\nCode\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds frame to each graph.\n\n\nCode\nset_graph_style() \n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunkc below, facet_nodes() is used.

There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here. Students are encouraged to refer to Chapter 7: Actor Prominence of A User’s Guide to Network Analysis in R to gain better understanding of theses network measures.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  mutate(betweenness_centrality = centrality_betweenness()) %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department,\n            size=betweenness_centrality))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nmutate() of dplyr is used to perform the computation.\nthe algorithm used, on the other hand, is the centrality_betweenness() of tidygraph.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that from ggraph v2.0 onward tidygraph algorithms such as centrality measures can be accessed directly in ggraph calls. This means that it is no longer necessary to precompute and store derived node and edge centrality measures on the graph in order to use them in a plot.\n\n\nCode\ng &lt;- GAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  ggraph(layout = \"fr\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = centrality_betweenness()))\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidygraph package inherits many of the community detection algorithms imbedded into igraph and makes them available to us, including Edge-betweenness (group_edge_betweenness), Leading eigenvector (group_leading_eigen), Fast-greedy (group_fast_greedy), Louvain (group_louvain), Walktrap (group_walktrap), Label propagation (group_label_prop), InfoMAP (group_infomap), Spinglass (group_spinglass), and Optimal (group_optimal). Some community algorithms are designed to take into account direction or weight, while others ignore it.

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nGAStech_graph\n\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function.

It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(plotly,patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggiraph)\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\nlibrary(ggiraph)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e.geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then,girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk,\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

    "text": "In this chapter, you will learn the basic principles and essential components of ggplot2. At the same time, you will gain hands-on experience on using these components to plot statistical graphics based on the principle of Layered Grammar of Graphics. By the end of this chapter you will be able to apply the essential graphical elements provided by ggplot2 to create elegant and yet functional statistical graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below assumes that you already have pacman package installed. If not, please go ahead install pacman first.\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package.\nreadr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\nYear end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.\nThere are a total of seven attributes.

Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?\nAs pointed out by Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978).

Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun.y=\"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun.y=\"mean\",           \n             colour =\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\nIn the code chunk below,geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble chart\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\nThe animated bubble plot above includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot. To overcome this problem, theme(legend.position='none') should be used as shown in the plot and code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nVisit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.\nBuilding an animation step-by-step with gganimate.\nCreating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels"

At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\n17.4.2 Importing the data\nFirst, you will use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks &lt;- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\")\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Examining the data structure\nIt is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack. It is in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\ntz field stores time zone of the source IP address.\n\n\n\n17.4.4 Data Preparation\nStep 1: Deriving weekday and hour of day fields\nBefore we can plot the calender heatmap, two new fields namely wkday and hour need to be derived. In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday &lt;- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times &lt;- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt &lt;- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package, and\nweekdays() is a base R function.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels &lt;- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  group_by(tz) %&gt;%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBeside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\n\n\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.5 Building the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped &lt;- attacks %&gt;% \n  count(wkday, hour) %&gt;% \n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk\n\n\n\n\na tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields.\na new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions.\nna.omit() is used to exclude missing value.\ngeom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles.\ntheme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot.\ncoord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1.\nscale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\n17.4.6 Building Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n17.4.7 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country &lt;- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 &lt;- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks &lt;- attacks %&gt;%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %&gt;%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n17.4.8 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

    "text": "Heatmaps visualise data through variations in colouring. When applied to a tabular format, heatmaps are useful for cross-examining multivariate data, through placing variables in the columns and observation (or records) in rowa and colouring the cells within the table. Heatmaps are good for showing variance across multiple variables, revealing any patterns, displaying whether any variables are similar to each other, and for detecting if any correlations exist in-between them.\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on using R to plot static and interactive heatmap for visualising and analysing multivariate data.\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you are required to open a new Quarto document. Keep the default html as the authoring format.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch seriation, heatmaply, dendextend and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(seriation, dendextend, heatmaply, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the data of World Happines 2018 report will be used. The data set is downloaded from here. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data frame format.\n\nwh &lt;- read_csv(\"data/WHData-2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibbled data frame is called wh.\n\n\n\nNext, we need to change the rows by country name instead of row number by using the code chunk below.\n\nrow.names(wh) &lt;- wh$Country\n\nNotice that the row number has been replaced into the country name.\n\n\n\nThe data was loaded into a data frame, but it has to be a data matrix to make your heatmap.\nThe code chunk below will be used to transform wh data frame into a data matrix.\n\nwh1 &lt;- dplyr::select(wh, c(3, 7:12))\nwh_matrix &lt;- data.matrix(wh)\n\nNotice that wh_matrix is in R matrix format.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many R packages and functions can be used to drawing static heatmaps, they are:\n\nheatmap()of R stats package. It draws a simple heatmap.\nheatmap.2() of gplots R package. It draws an enhanced heatmap compared to the R base function.\npheatmap() of pheatmap R package. pheatmap package also known as Pretty Heatmap. The package provides functions to draws pretty heatmaps and provides more control to change the appearance of heatmaps.\nComplexHeatmap package of R/Bioconductor package. The package draws, annotates and arranges complex heatmaps (very useful for genomic data analysis). The full reference guide of the package is available here.\nsuperheat package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps. A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types. The full reference guide of the package is available here.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static heatmaps by using heatmap() of R Stats package.\n\n\nIn this sub-section, we will plot a heatmap by using heatmap() of Base Stats. The code chunk is given below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      Rowv=NA, Colv=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nBy default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap. The arguments Rowv=NA and Colv=NA are used to switch off the option of plotting the row and column dendrograms.\n\nTo plot a cluster heatmap, we just have to use the default as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe order of both rows and columns is different compare to the native wh_matrix. This is because heatmap do a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.\nThe code chunk below normalises the matrix column-wise.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      scale=\"column\",\n                      cexRow = 0.6, \n                      cexCol = 0.8,\n                      margins = c(10, 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the values are scaled now. Also note that margins argument is used to ensure that the entire x-axis labels are displayed completely and, cexRow and cexCol arguments are used to define the font size used for y-axis and x-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves.

    "text": "heatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experiences on designing treemap using appropriate R packages. The hands-on exercise consists of three main section. First, you will learn how to manipulate transaction data into a treemap strcuture by using selected functions provided in dplyr package. Then, you will learn how to plot static treemap by using treemap package. In the third section, you will learn how to design interactive treemap by using d3treeR package.\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, you are required to check if treemap and tidyverse pacakges have been installed in you R.\n\npacman::p_load(treemap, treemapify, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and median() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\n\n\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\nvColor\n\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\n\n\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\n\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemapify is a R package specially developed to draw treemaps in ggplot2. In this section, you will learn how to designing treemps closely resemble treemaps designing in previous section by using treemapify. Before you getting started, you should read Introduction to “treemapify” its user guide.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),\n       layout = \"scol\",\n       start = \"bottomleft\") + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light blue\", high = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Region\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`),\n       start = \"topleft\") + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Area\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding boundary line\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = \"gray40\",\n                                size = 2) +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = \"gray20\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis slide shows you how to install a R package which is not available in cran.\n\nIf this is the first time you install a package from github, you should install devtools package by using the code below or else you can skip this step.\n\n\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n\nNext, you will load the devtools library and install the package found in github by using the codes below.\n\n\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"https://github.com/d3treeR/d3treeR\")\n\n\nNow you are ready to launch d3treeR package\n\n\nlibrary(d3treeR)\n\n\n\n\nThe codes below perform two processes.\n\ntreemap() is used to build a treemap by using selected variables in condominium data.frame.

    "text": "In this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and median() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\n\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "text": "Loading Packages\n\n\n\nLibrary\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npacman\nPacman is a package that makes it possible to perform tasks associated with add-on packages in a more convenient manner. It checks whether the add-on packages are installed or not. If not, it will automatically install and load them into the R environment. In this take-home exercise 1, the pacman package has been installed beforehand.\n\n\ntidyverse\nA collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. Content includes: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purr, tibble, stringr, forcats, scales, lubridate, etc.\n\n\nscales\nThis package is designed to enhance how data is presented in visualisation, particularly in ggplot2 plots. It provides tools for mapping data to aesthetic attributes like colours, shapes, and sizes more effectively. It also includes functions for formatting and transforming axes and legends in a chart. Even though this is part of the tidyverse package collection, it needs to be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\nlubridate\nIt is a package to work with date-times and time-spans: fast and user-friendly parsing of date-time data, extraction and updating of components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds), algebraic manipulation on date-time and time-span objects. This is part of the tidyverse collection, but it is not automatically loaded, so I will need to load it explicitly as I plan to use its functionality.\n\n\nggrepel\nAn R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels. This is not part of the tidyverse package collection, but it is an extension of ggplot2.\n\n\nggthemes\nAnother separate R package that provides additional themes and scales for ggplot2 to enhance the appearance of plots. This package will also need to be installed and loaded independently.\n\n\nhrbrthemes\nThis package provides additional typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2, focused on improving readability and appearance for data visualisation. It must be installed and loaded independently.\n\n\npatchwork\nThis one is also an extension package for ggplot2 that allows combining multiple ggplot2 plots into one (composite figure) and arranging them in various layouts. Even though patchwork complements the functionality of ggplot2, it is independently maintained and must be installed and loaded separately.\n\n\n\nThe following code chunk utilises the p_load() function from the pacman package to ensure that the necessary packages are available in the R environment. If the packages are already installed on the computer, p_load() will load them. If they are not installed, it will first install them and then load them into the R environment.\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, scales,\n               lubridate, ggrepel, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes, \n               patchwork, knitr)"

As far as I know, R does not differentiate between ‘dbl’ and ‘num’, so in this case, I will leave it as ‘dbl’ data type.\n\n\n\n\nQuarter 4, Year 2023:\n\nq4_2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240308161109.csv\")\n\nRows: 4851 Columns: 21\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (15): Project Name, Sale Date, Address, Type of Sale, Type of Area, Nett...\ndbl  (1): Number of Units\nnum  (5): Transacted Price ($), Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM),...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\nQuarter 1, Year 2024:\n\nq1_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ResidentialTransaction20240414220633.csv\")\n\nRows: 4902 Columns: 21\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (15): Project Name, Sale Date, Address, Type of Sale, Type of Area, Nett...\ndbl  (1): Number of Units\nnum  (5): Transacted Price ($), Area (SQFT), Unit Price ($ PSF), Area (SQM),...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI also noticed that the Sale Date data type format in all of these five datasets is ‘chr’ (character).

The trend exhibits significant fluctuations throughout the period, with peaks and troughs corresponding to market activities. Notably, there is a sharp increase in March 2024 as compared to February 2024, suggesting a spike in sales. Huttons Asia’s chief executive, Mark Yip, attributes this to the resumption of project launches in March following the Chinese New Year festive lull, which had a spillover effect on the resale market (Yip, 2024). The red dotted line represents the average sales volume over the period, providing a benchmark for monthly performance comparison. Months above this line experienced higher-than-average sales, while those below indicated fewer transactions, highlighting the variable buyer activity throughout the year.\nCitation: Yip, M.

Condominiums and apartments are the most commonly traded, suggesting a high demand for such property types, which could be due to their affordability and availability. Executive condominiums and detached houses represent a smaller fraction, likely reflecting their higher price points and more exclusive market position. The varied transaction volume across property types offers valuable insight into consumer preferences and the real estate market’s dynamics, particularly indicating a trend towards high-density living options."
