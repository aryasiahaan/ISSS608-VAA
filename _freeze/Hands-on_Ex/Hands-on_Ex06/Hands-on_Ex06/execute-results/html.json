They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.\n\nThe code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## **27.3 The Data**\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n### **27.3.1 The edges data**\n\n-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n",
