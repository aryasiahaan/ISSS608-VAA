By the end of this exercise, you will be able to:\n\n-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\n\n-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\n\n-   plot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n## **2.2 Getting started**\n\n### **2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries**\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\n-   ggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\n\n-   ggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\n\n-   hrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\n\n-   patchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\n\nCode chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto your working R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork,\n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npackage 'Rcpp' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'ggrepel' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Arya Siahaan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpaAERmN\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'patchwork' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Arya Siahaan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpaAERmN\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'ggthemes' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Arya Siahaan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpaAERmN\\downloaded_packages\npackage 'triebeard' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'httpuv' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'xtable' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'sourcetools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'later' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'promises' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'commonmark' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'urltools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'httpcode' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'shiny' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'crul' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'fontBitstreamVera' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'fontLiberation' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'extrafontdb' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'Rttf2pt1' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'gfonts' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'fontquiver' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'extrafont' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'gdtools' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\npackage 'hrbrthemes' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\Arya Siahaan\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpaAERmN\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### **2.2.2 Importing data**\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called *Exam_data* will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nThe code chunk below imports *exam_data.csv* into R environment by using [*read_csv()*](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam_data <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.\n\n-   The categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.\n\n-   The continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.\n\n## **2.3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel**\n\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n",
