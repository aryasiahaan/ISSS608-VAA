The packages used are listed below:\n\n| Library                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| [pacman](https://github.com/trinker/pacman)        | Pacman is a package that makes it possible to perform tasks associated with add-on packages in a more convenient manner. It checks whether the add-on packages are installed or not. If not, it will automatically install and load them into the R environment.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)            | A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling.

This enables stakeholders to discern which projects are more popular or command higher prices, potentially reflecting the reputation or desirability of the developers and locations involved.\n\n2.  **Total Units**:\n\n    -   **Goal**: To assess the scale of a project and its market absorption rate, with high sales volumes indicating high demand or effective pricing strategies, while low volumes may signal overpricing or less desirable attributes.\n\n    -   **Visualization**: The bar chart presents the total number of units sold per project. The descending order of bars (left to right) conveys which projects have the highest sales, which could be due to higher popularity or more effective market strategies. Projects with few units sold appear toward the right, highlighting potential issues or lower demand.\n\n3.  **Avg Unit Price PSM**:\n\n    -   **Goal**: To provide a comparative value indicator that normalizes prices across different sizes and types of properties, reflecting the price at which the market clears. This helps in understanding if there’s a relationship between the number of units sold and the price points.\n\n    -   **Visualization**: The box plot displays the distribution of unit prices per square meter for each project. This format shows the median, variability, and outliers in pricing within each project. It helps stakeholders see not just the average price but also how wide the price range is within each project, which can indicate a variety of unit types or varying desirabilities within a single project.\n\n### **How the Original Visualisation Achieves the Analytical Goals:**\n\n-   **Comparative Analysis**: By placing both plots side by side, viewers can compare the total number of units sold to the price distributions of those same projects. For example, a project with many units sold but lower price variability might suggest a well-received project priced effectively for its target market.\n\n-   **Market Insights**: Stakeholders can use this visual data to determine if projects with higher unit sales generally also command higher prices, or if prices are more competitive or lower despite high sales volumes, thus influencing future development and pricing strategies.\n\n-   **Developer Strategy**: Seeing which projects command higher prices and also have high sales can guide developers in mimicking successful features in future projects. Conversely, projects with low sales and low prices might indicate areas needing improvement or reevaluation of market fit.\n\n## Critique on Clarity and Aesthetics of the Original Visualisation\n\nOverall, the original visualisation aligns with the analytical goals by allowing for a detailed examination of both sales volume and pricing across projects, offering insights that can guide strategic decisions in real estate development. With that being said, there is still room for improvements, and some modifications would be beneficial to enhance its clarity and aesthetics.\n\n### **Clarity**\n\n1.  **Label Overcrowding**:\n\n    -   The project names on the x-axis are densely packed, making them hard to read. This affects the viewer's ability to quickly identify and compare projects.\n\n2.  **Scale and Balance**:\n\n    -   The scale of the bar chart and box plot do not align well.\n\n3.  **Data Visibility**:\n\n    -   In the box plot, some boxes and whiskers are thin or compressed due to the wide range of data, which can make it difficult to discern differences between the median and quartile values across projects.\n\n### **Aesthetics**\n\n1.  **Color and Design**:\n\n    -   Both plots use a simple, minimalistic color scheme which, while clean, could be enhanced to differentiate data points or groups more effectively. For example, different colors could be used to represent different quartiles in the box plot or to highlight projects with particularly high or low metrics in both plots.\n\n2.  **Consistency in Style**:\n\n    -   There is a visual inconsistency between the bar chart and the box plot that could be distracting. The bar chart is filled with a solid color, while the box plot is more traditional with outlines. Harmonizing these styles could improve the overall cohesion of the visualization.\n\n3.  **Utilization of Space**:\n\n    -   There's significant empty space at the right end of both plots, especially noticeable in the box plot. This could be better utilized by compressing the x-axis or by providing additional contextual information or annotations.\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\n1.  **Improving Label Readability**:\n\n    -   Rotate the position of the plot to a horizontal layout.\n\n    -   Reducing the number of projects with the highest 'Total_Units' sold from top 25 to just top 10.\n\n    -   Additional annotations could help to convey key information better for the viewer.\n\n    -   Boxplot may benefit from incorporating median price directly on the plot\n\n    -   Upsizing the labels on the y-axis and the x-axis\n\n    -   Repositioning the two plots from side-by-side to top-bottom alignment.\n\n2.  **Adjusting Scales and Ranges**:\n\n    -   Adjust the y-axis on the box plot to focus more closely on the interquartile range, possibly using a secondary axis or break in the axis to handle outliers.\n\n    -   Labels and ticks on the axes should be more readable, and using formatted numbers (like millions or rounding off) can help in understanding the scales at a glance without overwhelming with too many digits.\n\n3.  **Enhanced Color Coding and Visibility**:\n\n    -   Use color more strategically to highlight differences in data, such as coloring bars or boxes based on performance tiers (e.g., high, medium, low sales volume or prices).\n\n    -   Apply consistent thematic styling across both plots to enhance the visual narrative.\n\n    -   The use of a single color, while minimalist, could be expanded to differentiate data further. Using a palette to distinguish between different quartiles or highlighting specific noteworthy data points could make the visual more engaging.\n\n    -   Use different colours to denote different metrics like median, mean, or outliers in box plots.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex02_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1920}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresale_data <- data_cleaned %>%\n  filter(`Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\nproject_stats <- resale_data %>%\n  filter(`Project Name` != \"N.A.\") %>%\n  group_by(`Project Name`) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Total_Units = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Sum up all units for each project\n    Avg_Unit_Price = mean(`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE),  # Calculate the average price per square meter\n    .groups = \"drop\"  # Drop the grouping\n  )\n\ntop_projects <- project_stats %>%\n  top_n(10, Total_Units) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Units))\n\nproject_order <- top_projects$`Project Name`\n\ntop_projects$`Project Name` <- factor(top_projects$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\nresale_data$`Project Name` <- factor(resale_data$`Project Name`, levels = project_order)\n\n\n\np_units <- ggplot(top_projects, aes(x = reorder(`Project Name`, Total_Units), y = Total_Units)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = 'steelblue') +  \n  geom_text(aes(label = paste(Total_Units, \"units sold\")), position = position_nudge(y = 8), hjust = 1.5, color = \"white\", size = 6) +  # Add annotations with \"units sold\"\n  coord_flip() +  # Flips the axes to make the bar chart horizontal\n  labs(x = \"Project Name\", y = \"Total Units Sold\") +  # Change axis labels and update names\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 20),  # Enlarge y-axis labels\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 30),  # Enlarge x-axis labels\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge x-axis title\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge y-axis title\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n  \n\n  \np_price <- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n  \n# Calculate the interquartile range to adjust y-axis limits more appropriately\niqr <- IQR(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, na.rm = TRUE)\nq1 <- quantile(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)\nq3 <- quantile(resale_data$`Unit Price ($ PSM)`, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\nlower_bound <- max(0, q1 - 1.5 * iqr)  \nupper_bound <- q3 + 1.5 * iqr\n\n# Generate the boxplot with refined axis focus and number formatting\np_price <- ggplot(resale_data, aes(x = `Project Name`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSM)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"grey80\", colour = \"black\", outlier.colour = \"red\", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 1) +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flip the axes for horizontal layout\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(lower_bound, upper_bound), labels = scales::comma) +  # Apply comma for thousands\n  labs(x = \"Project Name\", y = \"Unit Price ($ PSM)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 20),  # Enhance readability of the x-axis labels\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, size = 30),  # Enhance readability of the y-axis labels\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge x-axis title\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 24),  # Enlarge y-axis title\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n\n  )\n\n\n\np_combined <- p_units / p_price # Change | to / to stack plots vertically\np_combined\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n# Learning Takeaways\n\nImproving these visualisations has helped me better understand the importance of clarity and precision in data presentation. Through this process, I have improved my ability to manipulate graphical properties in ggplot2, thereby enhancing readability and conveying information more effectively. Adjusting elements such as bar width, text annotations, and axis labels not only makes the visualisation more aesthetically pleasing but also more intuitive and informative for the audience. By customising text sizes, adjusting plot dimensions, and fine-tuning the placement of text annotations, I have observed how minor changes can significantly impact the viewer's ability to quickly understand and interpret data. This experience has deepened my understanding of the crucial role of thoughtful visualisation design in data science, where the goal is not merely to present data but to tell a compelling story with it.\n",
